The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Bootstrap for styling and Font Awesome for icons.**

**Edit Task:** Users can edit existing tasks by clicking on the edit icon next to each task.

**Persistent Storage:** The app uses local storage to save tasks, ensuring that the user's tasks are available even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

**Responsive Design:** The app is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
